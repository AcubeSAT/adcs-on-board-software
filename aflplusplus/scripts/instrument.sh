# Control Flow Integrity SANitizer, finds instances where the control flow is found to be illegal
# export AFL_USE_CFISAN=1

# Thread SANitizer, finds thread race conditions

# Currently can't use due to target (llvm translation) weirdness:
# ========

# Address SANitizer, finds memory corruption vulnerabilities

# Undefined Behavior SANitizer, finds instances where - by the C++ standards - undefined behavior happens
