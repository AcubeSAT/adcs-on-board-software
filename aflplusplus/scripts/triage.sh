# cwdump is used to summarize the crashes in the crashwalk database
# by bucketing by major/minor stack hash.
# Although AFL already de-dupes crashes,
# bucketing summarizes these by an order of magnitude or more.
# Crashes that bucket the same have exactly the same stack contents,
# so they're likely (but NOT guaranteed) to be the same bug.
