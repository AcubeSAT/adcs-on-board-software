  # A hack to be able to source .bashrc from inside the shell script.
  # See https://askubuntu.com/a/77053/1165092

  # Note that if you run the script as source all env changes
  # made by the script will be immediately reflected in your working environment
  # and, therefore, in all subsequent script executions.
  # Otherwise the terminal will not reflect the env changes caused.
  # In other words, you still have to
  # either re-source ~/.bashrc manually, or restart the terminal.
